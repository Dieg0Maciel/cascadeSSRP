# NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SAMPLE SPACE REDUCING PROCESSES
## Overview
Sample Space Reducing Processes reduce their sample space as they progress over time. They can
be depicted by the following diagram

Sample space reducing processes(SSRPs) are processes that reduce their sample space as they progress over time. They where first studied in:

A generalization of the SSRPs called "Cascade SSRPs" was presented in:

The file "cascadeSSRP.cpp" contains a numerical simulation of a cascade SSRP which is executed by the script "simulation.py". It compares the numerical simulation with theoretical predictions reproducing the results in Figure 2(b) of the article:
