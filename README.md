## Sample space reducing processes(SSRPs) 

Sample space reducing processes(SSRPs) are processes that reduce their sample space as they progress over time. They where first studied in:
* https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1420946112
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2775 (PrePrint)

A generalization of the SSRPs called "Cascade SSRPs" was presented in:
* https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09836-4
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10100 (PrePrint)


Using those previous results in
* https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28962-1
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10202 (PrePrint)
was studied how driving rates determine the statistics of driven non-equilibrium systems with stationary distributions.

## Numerical Simulation
The file "cascadeSSRP.cpp" contains a numerical simulation of a cascade SSRP which is executed by the script "simulation.py". It compares the numerical simulation with theoretical predictions reproducing the results in Figure 2(b) of the article:
