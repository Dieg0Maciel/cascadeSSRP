# NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SAMPLE SPACE REDUCING PROCESSES
## Overview



## References
Sample space reducing processes(SSRPs) are processes that reduce their sample space as they progress over time. They where first studied in:
* [Corominas-Murtra, Bernat, Rudolf Hanel, and Stefan Thurner. "Understanding scaling through history-dependent processes with collapsing sample space." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112.17 (2015): 5348-5353.] (https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1420946112)
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2775 (PrePrint)

A generalization of the SSRPs called "Cascade SSRPs" was presented in:
* https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09836-4
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10100 (PrePrint)

The file "cascadeSSRP.cpp" contains a numerical simulation of a cascade SSRP which is executed by the script "simulation.py". It compares the numerical simulation with theoretical predictions reproducing the results in Figure 2(b) of the article:
